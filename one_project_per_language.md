# One project per language âš¡
## Test all languages and frameworks
Given my passion for experimenting with new things, I decided to challenge myself and start an exciting project.
In this challenge, I intend to select a project for each language and framework and do it.
At the end of each project, I will publish my experience of the project and the language. I will also share how long it took me to complete the project, this makes us we to understand how difficult or easy a language or a framework is. 
I'm sure it will be an interesting trip;)
I will list all these projects to be done here.
